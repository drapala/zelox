# Drift Check Refactoring Summary

## Task Completed
Refactored `scripts/drift_check.py` from monolithic to modular architecture

## Before
- **Confusion Score:** 37.4
- **Indirection Depth:** 9 levels
- **Context Switches:** 148
- **Lines of Code:** 233 (single file)
- **Structure:** Single DriftChecker class with mixed responsibilities

## After
- **Estimated Confusion Score:** < 15
- **Indirection Depth:** 3 levels max
- **Lines of Code Distribution:**
  - `drift_check.py`: 90 LOC (orchestration)
  - `drift_detection/block_finder.py`: 93 LOC
  - `drift_detection/drift_calculator.py`: 136 LOC
  - `drift_detection/drift_reporter.py`: 111 LOC

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **BlockFinder**: Only finds blocks (single responsibility)
- **DriftCalculator**: Only calculates drift metrics
- **DriftReporter**: Only generates reports
- **Main Script**: Simple orchestration

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Hash-based initial comparison for identical blocks
- Caching for similarity calculations
- Early exit for exact matches

### 3. Enhanced Features
- Multiple output formats (JSON, text, markdown, CI)
- Better CLI interface with examples
- More comprehensive test coverage

### 4. LLM-Friendly Design
- Each module is self-contained
- Clear data flow between components
- Frozen dataclasses for immutability
- Explicit type hints throughout

## Testing Results
âœ… All 7 tests passing
- Exact duplication detection
- Whitespace tolerance
- Drift detection
- Orphaned block handling
- Multi-language support
- Report generation
- Performance caching

## Next Steps
- Monitor performance in production
- Consider parallel file processing for large repos
- Add configuration file support for custom tolerances
